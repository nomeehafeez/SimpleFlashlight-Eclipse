Simple Flashlight
==================
This app was developed as a way to start familiarizing myself more with Java/Android development and the Google Play Development Console, Google Play Store and GitHub workflows.  Feel free to use this code as a reference or to update it and make it better.  Keep the permissions required to only what the app needs to do it's primary job.  No ads and no nag screens either.  Keep it simple and clean for the user.

The [Simple Flashlight app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wolfhorse.simpleflashlight) can be downloaded from Google Play for free.
